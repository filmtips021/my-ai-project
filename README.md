# MySimpleAI: Waste Sorter

## Summary

MySimpleAI is a simple AI tool that classifies waste images into recyclable and non-recyclable categories. It automates waste sorting for small facilities. Building AI course project.

## Background

Waste sorting is often done manually, leading to errors and inefficiencies. MySimpleAI uses a basic AI model to improve recycling accuracy.
* Manual sorting errors  
* Environmental impact

## How is it used?

Users take a photo of waste, and MySimpleAI quickly classifies it as recyclable or non-recyclable. This solution can be integrated into recycling bins or mobile apps for real-time sorting.

## Data sources and AI methods

Data is sourced from public waste image datasets and field-collected samples. A simple convolutional neural network is used for image classification.

## Challenges

Limited to two waste categories
May struggle with mixed or unclear waste images
Environmental factors can affect image quality

## What next?

Expand to include more waste categories
Improve accuracy with additional training data
Develop a mobile or web application for wider use

    #Basic classification logic would be input here
    return "recyclable"
